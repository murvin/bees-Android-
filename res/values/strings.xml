        <item>All searches are localized based on the center of your map. When you type a keyword the default search filters are applied and the map center is used as your location. Events are displayed on the map and listed on the bottom horizontal list. Both are click-able and will navigate to the list view.</item>
        <item>Events are paginated in pages of 30 items. You can see which page you are currently viewing from the top action bar label (1). To download the next available page you can simply hit the More button (2) on the top action bar.</item>
        <item>You can change event search filters such as category, date, sorting style and proximity radius on the list screen top section (1). Once changed a new search is launched based on your last keyword and the updated filters. You can play along and discover what filters get you the most results.</item>
        <item>The event list screen shows all event details on a horizontal list (1) with a list preview on the left (2). You can buy tickets for the event (3) from the details page. Any further selection on the details page will take you to the Eventul corresponding website.</item>
        <item>You can save an event directly to your device calendar by selecting the Calendar context menu option on the top action bar (1). This option will open up the Event entry application (2) that will allow you to further edit the event details before saving.</item>
        <item>Most events from Eventful have precise geolocations and as such you can have a door to door journey navigation to the event by selecting the Directions option from the top action bar (1). This will call the device built in map handler (2) to assist you in the journey.</item>
        <item>The top share context menu option (1) allows you to send the event web link via as many handlers as your device possesses. Some examples are Email, Bluetooth and Facebook. (2)</item>
